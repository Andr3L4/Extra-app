        <h1>History of Coffee</h1>
        <p>Coffee is believed to have originated from the highlands of Ethiopia. According to legend, a goat herder named Kaldi discovered coffee around 850 AD. He noticed that his goats became more energetic after eating the berries from a certain tree.</p>
        <p>The knowledge of coffee then spread to the Arabian Peninsula, where it was cultivated and traded. By the 15th century, coffee was being grown in the Yemeni district of Arabia and was popularized in the Islamic world. Coffee houses, known as "qahveh khaneh," began to emerge in cities such as Constantinople (Istanbul) and Mecca, becoming centers of social activity and intellectual discussion.</p>
        <p>In the 17th century, coffee was introduced to Europe, leading to the establishment of the first coffeehouses in cities like Venice, London, and Paris. These coffeehouses quickly became important social hubs, known as "penny universities" because for the price of a penny, one could purchase a cup of coffee and engage in intellectual conversations.</p>
        <p>Throughout the centuries, coffee has continued to spread and evolve, becoming one of the most popular beverages in the world.</p>
